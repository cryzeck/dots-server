### install ###

the `dots` repo is cloned to `$HOME` and each item is installed using [gnu stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow bin
stow picom
stow git
stow i3
...
```

each directory that has been stowed has its contents linked to the `$HOME` directory while still being centrally located in my `$HOME/dotfiles` git repo.
